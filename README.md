# Breakout Board for ESP-12E and ESP-12F

This repo contains all the design files to make a breakout board for the ESP-12E and the ESP-12F which will allow you to use the ESP module on a breadboard.

The project was created using KiCAD v6.

## Design Goals

1. Breadboard compatible (i.e. 2.54mm pitch)
1. Breadboard connection doesn't cover all the breadboard holes
1. Max 2-sided PCB
1. As small (read: cheap to fabricate) as possible
